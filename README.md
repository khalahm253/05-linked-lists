====

Travis Link : https://travis-ci.com/khalahm253/05-linked-lists

#### In thid lab we need to :
* implement a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structure
* implement `append(value)`, `prepend(value)`, `reverse()`, and `remove(offset)` methods to the SLL class
* implement `serialize()` and `deserialize()` methods on the class
* in a comment within each function, note the it's Big-O runtime

#### Testing  
  * write at least three test assertions for each method of the Singly Linked List Data Structure
  * organize your tests into appropriate describe/it blocks for test output readability
